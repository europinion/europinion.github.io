Why we are doing what we are doing.

Europinion shows the results of a project about sentiment analysis 
concerning the elections of the European Parliament in 2019. The project has been 
realized for the “Knowledge Representation and Extraction” course of the Master Degree 
in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, under prof. Aldo Gangemi.
